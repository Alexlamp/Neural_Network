# Neural_Network
## Introduction

I was challenged with building a machine learning model that would be able to predict the success of a venture paid by finctional corporation, Alphabet soup. My trained model will be used to determine the future decisions of the company. The projects likely to be a success will receive future funding from Alphabet Soup.

- Implement neural network models using TensorFlow. <br>
- Preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models. <br>
- Compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks. <br>
- Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow. <br>
- Save trained TensorFlow models for later use. <br>

## Goals
- Import, analyze, clean, and preprocess a “real-world” classification dataset. <br>
- Select, design, and train a binary classification model of your choosing. <br>
- Optimize model training and input data to achieve desired model performance. <br>

## Materials
- Python 3 <br>
- Jupyter Notebok <br>
- charity_data.csv <br>
