# Neural_Network
## Introduction

I was challenged with building a machine learning model that would be able to predict the success of a venture paid by finctional corporation, Alphabet soup. My trained model will be used to determine the future decisions of the company. The projects likely to be a success will receive future funding from Alphabet Soup.

- Implement neural network models using TensorFlow. <br>
- Preprocess and construct datasets for neural network models. <br>
- Compare the differences between neural network models and deep neural networks. <br>
- Implement deep neural network models using TensorFlow. <br>
- Save trained TensorFlow models for later use. <br>

## Goals
- Import, analyze, clean, and preprocess a “real-world” classification dataset. <br>
- Select, design, and train a binary classification model of your choosing. <br>
- Optimize model training and input data to achieve desired model performance. <br>

## Materials
- Python 3 <br>
- Jupyter Notebok <br>
- charity_data.csv <br>

## Analysis
#### How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model?
For my neural network model I I used 2 hidden layers. On the first hidden layer I used 80 neurons and on the second layer I used 30 neurons.

#### Were you able to achieve target model performance?
No, Unfortuently I was unable to achieve the target predictive accuracy of 75% or higher. Through experimentation, I increased the amount of epochs from 50 to 100 and finally 200. This however did not significantly inprove the accuracy of the model. The range that I was able to achieve was between 72-73.6% 

#### What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

#### If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose and why?
